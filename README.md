📸 Instagram Clone (UI Only)
This is a UI-only clone of Instagram built with Flutter. 🎉 The app replicates the design and layout of Instagram's core screens, providing a pixel-perfect look and feel. While no backend functionality is implemented, it serves as a great starting point for building out a fully functional social media app! 🚀
